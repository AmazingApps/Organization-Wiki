1. Can I quote any content?

    Of course you can. Just remember to claim [source](http://amazingapps.org/).

2. Can I suggestion a new app? What if I am developer of the app? And how?

    Anyone is welcome to suggest a new app to contribute. 

    You can send feedback via [email](mailto:public@amazingapps.org).

    But it is strongly recommended to use GitHub account to:

    * create a new issue with app name & official web on corresponding repository.

    * send me pull request to fix it directly. 

    Contribution is always welcome anyway. Plus, pls also go through [contribution guidelines](/contribution-guidelines.md).

3. Hey. PUA in your list!!!!

4. Why didn't you enable ebooks generation on GitBook?

    Considering that how great update the work amount and how high update frequency can be, a stable ebook release is NOT practical at all.
