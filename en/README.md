## Organization wiki

---

This repo aims to collect excellent Windows apps to save time from finding them.

Whether an app is amazing never means more collaborators, advanced tech., money or knowledge. What really matters is consciousness and quality from developers. There is, hence, a black list at the end for reference.

You are NOT allowed to make a profit with any contents in any repository in this organization without permission.

⚠️Although all apps are listed here after testing, but it can still introduce problem by updating versions. This repository may not update to keep up so they come with no guaranty. What matters most is still your habits and ability to distinguish.
